# Brief History of JavaScript

---

## Before: JavaScript is NOT a real language

^In the past, I would often here from software engineers (especially pure back-end developers) doubts whether JavaScript could serve as a workable programming language; instead favoring languages such as Java, Python or C++.

---

## Now: JavaScript is THE language

---

### It’s fair to say, early JavaScript had its [quirks](http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/javascript/excerpts/javascript-good-parts/bad-parts.html), but ES6 represents a significant move forward for JavaScript.

---

### Let’s look at the history of the language... those who don't know the history can't make it.

---

## A brief JavaScript timeline

---

### 1995: JavaScript is born as LiveScript at Netscape

---

### 1997: ECMAScript standard is established by European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)

---

### 1999: ES3 comes out and IE5 is all the rage; the most popular debugging method is `alert(error);`

---

### 2000-2005: `XMLHttpRequest`, a.k.a. AJAX, gains popularity in app such as Outlook Web Access (2000) and Oddpost (2002), Gmail (2004) and Google Maps (2005)

---

### 2009: ES5 comes out (this is what most of us use now) with `forEach`, `Object.keys`, `Object.create` (specially for [Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com)), and standard JSON

---

### 2015: ES6/ECMAScript2015 comes out fixing a lot of bad parts

---

### 2016: ES7 is on the [horizon](http://www.2ality.com/2015/11/tc39-process.html)

---

### Enough with this JavaScript history lesson

---

# ECMAScript

---

### ECMAScript (or ES) is a trademarked scripting-language specification standardized by Ecma International in ECMA-262 and ISO/IEC 16262.


---

### ECMA is  European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA)
