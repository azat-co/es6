# What is Babel

---

## Problem: Old browsers (IE9) will never support ES6. How do you know or enforec that all your users use modern browsers?

---

### Most of the times you cannot.

---

### Write for both?

---

### Babel converts ES6 code into ES5-compatible code.

---

## How to use Babel

* Babel command-line interface (CLI) tool
* Node.js or browser JavaScript script (API approach)
* Build tool

---

## Babel RELP

```js
const a = 1
let f = (r={}) => r
```

---

# Using Babel CLI

---

### Let's use Babel CLI

---

Firsly, ensure Node v6.2.0, and npm v3.8.9:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

---


### Create a new folder `es6-test`: `mkdir es6-test`

---

### Create `package.json` inside of your new folder with `npm init -y`

---

Define Babel presets in `package.json`:


```js
{
  ...
  "babel": {
    "presets": ["es2015"]
  }  
}
```

 or `.babelrc`:

```js
{
  "presets": ["es2015"]
}  
```

---

### Optionally, fill `package.json` with information such as project name, license, GitHub repository, etc.

---

### Install Babel CLI and React preset locally using `npm i babel-cli@6.9.0 babel-preset-es2015@6.5.0 --save-dev` to save these dependencies in `devDependencies` in `package.json`

---

Test run to see you have Babel CLI:

```
./node_modules/.bin/babel --version
```

(You should see v6.9.0. babel --version might also work depending on your npm configuration.)

---

If you use React and JSX, you can also add React preset to convert JSX to React:

```
npm i babel-preset-react@6.5.0 --save-dev
```

And add to presets configuration next to `es2015`:

```js
{
"presets": ["react", "es2015"]
}
```

---

After installation, you issue a command to process your `src/script.js` ES6 into `js/script.js` ES5 JavaScript:

```
./node_modules/.bin/babel src/script.js -o js/script.js
```

---

Optionally, create an npm script `npm run build`. Just open `package.json` with your editor and add this line to `scripts`:

```
{
  ...
  "scripts": [
    "build": "./node_modules/.bin/babel src/script.js -o js/script.js"
  ],
  ...
}
```

---


You can automate this command with the watch option (-w or --watch):

```
./node_modules/.bin/babel src/script.js -o js/script.js -w
```

---

The Babel command to watch for any changes in `src/script.js` and compile it to `js/script.js` when you save the updated ES6 file. When it happens, terminal/command prompt will display:

```
change src/script.js
```

---

When you start having more JSX files, simply use the command with -d (--out-dir) and folder names to compile each ES6 source files (`src`) into many regular JS files (`build`):

```
./node_modules/.bin/babel src --d build
```

---

Often times, having just a single file to load is better for the performance of a front-end app than loading many files. This is because each request add a delay. We can compile all files in the source directory into a single regular JS file with -o (--out-file):

```
./node_modules/.bin/babel src -o script-compiled.js
```

---

## Bonus üéÅ

---

### Remember stages 0-4 in section 1?

---

### You can start using these features NOW!


---

## Stage 0 is THE cutting edge.

---

In terminal/command prompt (replace 0 with 0-3):

```
npm install --save-dev babel-preset-stage-0
```

In `.babelrc`:

```
{
  "presets": ["stage-0"]
}
```

Or instead of `.babelrc` in `package.json`:

```js
{  
  ...
  "babel": {
    "presets": ["stage-0"]
  }
}
```

---

## More Presets

* es2015-lose
* es2016
* es2017
* latest
* react
* stage-0, 1, 2, 3
